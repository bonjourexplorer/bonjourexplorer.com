The big city in my small world, the weekend getaway, and eventually, the home that will always be \"my home.\" While Atlanta doesn't always make it on everyone's bucket list, it truly is an underrated city. The amazing food scene, inventive art space, and blend of old-fashion southern hospitality with progressive ideals, Atlanta has become the best kept secret of The South."

The food? The architecture? The art? The culture? It’s simply perfect. Except it’s not. Too many have over-idealized this city only to be disappointed when finally reaching it. Go knowing it’s imperfect so that you can see just how perfect it is!"
